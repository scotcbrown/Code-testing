    <title> How to Insert link in HTMl Code </title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <p> In HTML, you can insert a link using the <a> (anchor) tag. The href attribute specifies the URL where the link will direct users. For example, <a href="https://ikonicdev.com/">Ikonic Dev</a> creates a clickable link labeled "Visit Example." You can also add target="_blank" to open the link in a new tab.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can style links using CSS to enhance their appearance. By default, links appear blue and underlined, but you can modify this with CSS like a { color: red; text-decoration: none; }. This improves usability and design.</p>
